define the quiz() method:
    set the possible mathematical operator_types as +, -, and *

    Initialize player_score to 0
    Initialize player_answer to 0

    for a counter variable count from 0 - 10: ie repeat 10 times:
        set question_operator to a random choice of operator_types
        set first_number to a random integer between 1 and 12
        set second_number to a random integer between 1 and 12

        ask the user what is <first_number> <question_operator> <second_number>?

        while True:
            ask the user for their answer
            break out of loop
        except if they have entered an invalid number:
            tell user to ensure that they enter a number

        if the question_operator is +:
            set the correct_answer to first_number + second_number
        else if the question_operator is -:
            set the correct_answer to first_number - second_number
        else:
            set the correct_answer to first_number * second_number

        if the correct_answer is the same as the player_answer:
            add 1 to player_score
            tell user that they got the answer correct
        else:
            tell the user that they got the answer wrong
            tell the user the correct_answer

    tell the user their final player_score

    return player_score
